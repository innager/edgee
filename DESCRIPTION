Description: The package performs high-dimensional data analysis using empirical
    Edgeworth expansions (EE) for one- and two-sample ordinary and moderated
    t-statistics, as well as Welch t-test. It performs tail diagnostic based on
    EE and calculates various components of EE when distribution parameters or
    their estimates are provided. The package also includes unbiased central
    moment estimators for one- and two-sample tests up to 6th order.
